# Week 4 Challenge Assignment - Code Quiz (Focus: JavaScript)

The purpose of this week's challenge is to build out a code quiz relying heavily on JavaScript, event listeners, and acting upon events that happen on the web page. The assignment featured several criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

When you review my code, you will observe feature functionality like saving your score and name to local storage, as well as reviewing high scores, is not available. I hope to complete this shortly. Below are a few screenshots which provide visual guide to how the program looks:
